Magic, known as the Horn’s Echo, flows through forest, mountain, and sea — a raw, untamed force that resists the chains of civilization.\n\nIt is a land scarred by two living memories:\n\nThe Shadow Plague – A generation ago, a sickness of darkness swept the world, extinguishing whole villages in silence. The plague dimmed not only the land’s light but also its spirit — the sun itself seems weaker since those days. Survivors whisper it was no mere disease, but the punishment of a god, or perhaps the stirring of something far worse beneath the earth.\n\nThe Rule of the Mad King – In the plague’s aftermath, a mortal king rose who claimed he alone could awaken Pan. Obsessed and half-divine in fury, he waged wars that erased entire kingdoms, burning the land in his desperate attempt to rouse the sleeping god. His fall ended the wars, but his shadow lingers — ruins of his empire still stand as warnings, and cults devoted to his vision plot in secret.\n\nNow, the world is defined by its ongoing struggle:\n\nThe Silence of Pan – Pan, the creator, slumbers beneath the roots of the world. The pantheon’s voices are divided, and mortals squabble in the void of his silence. Some await his return as salvation; others dread it as the end of all things.\n\nOrder vs. the Wild – Kingdoms claw at survival and dominion, carving roads, laws, and thrones into a land that will not bow. The sacred places remain untamed, guarded by beings older than kings. To trespass is to invite ruin, yet ambition drives mortals to gamble with fire.\n\nEryndor is a land of ruins and rebirth, where kingdoms rise upon bones, myths may yet wake, and the light of civilization flickers fragile against the endless wild.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"displayIndex":0,"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"1":{"uid":1,"key":["the time of shadows","the great darkness","the shadow plague","shadow plague","the plague","the grey curse","the rot","the shroud","the sunless years"],"keysecondary":["husk","whispering death"],"comment":"event_shadow_plague","content":"The Shadow Plague (also called \"The Great Darkness\" or \"The Whispering Death\") was a catastrophic magical pandemic that occurred 150 years ago.

She serves as the world's safeguard and his sole alarm clock. Should creation ever falter, dim, or fall into irreversible despair—should the music of existence fade—her purpose is to ignite a cataclysm so profound it will rouse Pan from his eternal rest. This makes her both a protector and a latent destroyer, a duality that defines her.\n\nShe manifests as a figure of ever-shifting flame and light. Her voice crackles like a roaring hearth, and her gaze is the intense, focused heat of a forge.

Driven mad by grief and the lingering touch of the Plague, he became convinced that the god Pan had not just slept but had been *stolen* from the world, and that he alone could awaken him.\n\n### THE WAR OF AWAKENING\nBelieving that only an cataclysmic event of equal measure could rouse the slumbering deity, the king waged a series of horrific wars known as the War of Awakening. His strategy was one of absolute divinely-inspired fury: he sought to burn the world to get its god's attention. His magically-enhanced armies, fueled by his half-divine madness, erased entire kingdoms from the map, scouring the land with fire and blood in a desperate, genocidal attempt to awaken Pan.\n\n### HIS FALL & LEGACY\nThe Mad King's fall is shrouded in mystery, likely a coup from his own exhausted generals or a strike by the first Blightwardens. His empire collapsed almost overnight. His legacy is one of utter devastation:\n- **The Scoured Lands:** Vast regions remain barren and haunted, dotted with the ruins of his fortresses and the graves of kingdoms he destroyed.\n- **A Political Vacuum:** The map was redrawn by his wars, leading to the rise of new powers and centuries of instability in the regions he shattered.\n- **The Embered Hand:** A fanatical cult that worships the Mad King as a martyr and prophet.

This echo is a resonance shaped by the soul's deeds, its purity of intent, and the attention of the divine. A life of virtue creates a clear, harmonious note; a life of chaos creates a dissonant one. This is not a judgment, but a simple consequence of existence.\n\n### PAN'S SILENCE IS THE FINAL JUDGE\nThe nature of the afterlife is defined by the silence of the sleeping god, Pan. It is unknown if he hears the echoes of every passing soul but chooses not to respond, or if the Horn of the World itself acts in his stead, \"calling back\" souls based on the quality of their resonance. This divine ambiguity is the source of both hope and terror for mortals.\n\n### SHADOWS AND LIGHT INTERTWINE\nAll souls enter a twilight realm—a liminal space between the material world and the divine planes. Here, the resonance of their echo determines their fate:\n- **The Worthy:** Those whose lives created a harmonious resonance are believed to find peace, passing fully into the divine light or becoming one with the world's song.\n- **The Lost:** The reckless, cruel, or arrogant create dissonant echoes.
